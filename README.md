 WORD-LE FInder | CIS-255 Final Project | SC4

This project is creates a webpage where the user can get help with solutions to the infamous "Wordle" game. To fit this, I like to call this project the "WORD-LE Finder." This project is a compilation of the skills learned through my CIS-255 Web Publishing course where we were asked to make a program utilizing all of the elements involved in the class: HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL. While ideally this project would have been made more versatile to work on other devices, this was made specifically for computer use. The documentation within this project walks through how the project itself works and contains the basic algorithm used, some tests that it works properly, and validation for any possible problems with the code.

This project was created on April 26, 2022
